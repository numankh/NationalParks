                            Our team was able to create a fully-functional web application that provides helpful tools for both potential and past visitors of US National Parks. Unlike some other national park web applications, our web application not only provides plenty of detailed information on each park in US, but also includes functionality for a user to schedule a trip to one of these national parks. The trip planner gives the user the ability to see the how the drive is to get to the national park, view events happening at the park during their stay, book a flight and/or hotel, and email/text other family or friends about their trip plans. Furthermore, our web application has a blog page for each national park that allows past users provide relevant information on each park that will be very helpful for potential visitors.
